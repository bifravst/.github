# Contributing to our projects

This guide is intended for providing information on contributing codebases our
team maintains. As a first step, see our
[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Finding open issues

A list of issues marked with `help-wanted` is maintained in each projects issue
list. These issues are good starting points for contributing to the project.
Some of them require in-depth knowledge about the technology in use.

Issues tagged with `good first issues` are very small issues that can help you
to get familiar with the codebase.

## Improving documentation

If you have suggestions on improving the documentation for a project, open a new
PR in the project repository.

## Other changes

Please use the _Discussions_ feature first before creating a PR that does not
match one of the above. If _Discussions_ are disabled in the repository, create
a new issue and describe the change you would like to work on.
